# git_repos_filter
Tool developed to do quantitative mining of software repositories on GitHub and documentation of all results.
The tool also has the functionality to work with the results, performing operations between different results.


## Current limitations
1- Even using pagination tool can only return maximum of 1000 repositories (can count all, but return only 1000)
2- Can only exclude maximum of 5 keywords or parameters

## Next steps
1- Implement operation with results
